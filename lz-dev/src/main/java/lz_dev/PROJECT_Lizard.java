     * Should the client side of node/index actually be in query-server?
     *   No - isolated testing for node and index need the client side.
     *   Yes - no need for index-server to depend on quack
     *   Or quack should be split?
     *   Or More of the Index table client shoud be in query-server.
     *     Too many modules results in opaque chaos.
